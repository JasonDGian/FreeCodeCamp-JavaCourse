/**
 * There are managers who administer bank accounts and attend to their owners.
 * Each account, if it has one, has a unique manager.
 * 
 * Design the manager class which includes their name, phone number, and the
 * maximum authorized amount they can operate with.
 * 
 * Regarding the managers, the following restrictions exist: - A manager will
 * always have a name and phone number. - If not assigned, the maximum
 * authorized amount is â‚¬10,000. - A manager, once assigned, cannot change their
 * phone number. Everyone will be able to consult it. - The name will be public
 * and the maximum authorized amount will only be visible to neighboring
 * classes.
 * 
 * Modify the current account class so that it can have a manager and write the
 * necessary methods.
